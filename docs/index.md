# 🚀 ProdigyFlow — Intelligent Data Analytics Agent

ProdigyFlow is an **AI-powered multi-agent data analytics framework** designed to automate end-to-end exploratory analysis, visualization, insights generation, and reporting. It enables students, analysts, and researchers to turn raw datasets into meaningful business insights with minimal manual effort.

This project has been developed as part of an academic capstone initiative by:
**Malliboyina Surya Manikanta**,  
Department of Computer Science & Engineering.

## Project Motivation — Why I Chose This

In real-world business environments, analysts spend **70–80% of time cleaning, exploring, and summarizing data** before any modelling or decision-making. This process is repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to error.

I wanted to build a system that:

- **Speeds up exploratory analysis**
- **Automatically generates insights and visual summaries**
- **Allows anyone to analyze datasets without advance ML knowledge**
- Demonstrates practical learning combining **Python + Data Analytics + Gemini AI**

ProdigyFlow reflects our goal to create **simple, useful, modular tools** that solve real analytical problems while being easy for students and businesses to adopt.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a backend-first analytics automation system using agent architecture.
- Support data ingestion, cleaning, visualization, metadata extraction, and insight generation.
- Utilize **Gemini models** for natural-language summaries and understanding.
- Create a structured, competition-ready engineering pipeline.
- Deliver high-value analytical output with minimal coding.

## ✨ What I Learned

- Designing **modular agent architectures**
- Integrating **Gemini AI** with Python backends
- Automating analytics workflows like real data analysts
- Practical environment setup, dependency management & debugging
- Dataset quality, structure, visualization and reporting best practices
- Leveraging GitHub workflow and documentation standards

---

## Future Scope

🔹 Build a Web-based interface using FastAPI/Streamlit
🔹 Add database integration and Auto-EDA dashboards
🔹 Support PDF report generation
🔹 Multi-file dataset comparison
🔹 Plug-and-play Machine Learning agent

ProdigyFlow is only the beginning — I plan to expand it into a fully intelligent analytical automation assistant.
